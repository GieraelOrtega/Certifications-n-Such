Notes/Areas to Study
====================
```
- Nexpose is a vulnerability scanner. Splunk, ArcSight, and QRadar are all examples of security information and event managers (SIEM).

- Technical Controls   = Systems, devices, software, settings that work to enforce CIA
- Operational Controls = Practices and procedures that bolster cybersecurity (Think PenTests)

- In-Band NAC Solutions     = Using appliances between devices and resource(s) being accessed
- Out-of-Band NAC Solutions = Leveraging existing infra and reconfiguring to grant/deny access

- NIST SP 800-30 = Risk Assessment Methodology (Prepare, Conduct, Communicate, Maintain)

- Well-Known Ports = 0-1023
- Registered Ports = 1024-49151 (Registered by IANA)

- Cacti        = Open source tool that uses SNMP to get net device info for graphical view
- SIEM Tools   = Arcsight, QRadar, Splunk, AlienVault, OSSIM, Kiwi Syslog
- Vuln Scanner = Nessus, QualysGuard, Nikto (Web), Nexpose, MBSA, ModSecurity, OpenVAS
- PenTest Tool = Metasploit
- IDS Names    = Snort, Bro
- IPS Names    = Sourcefire
- WAF Names    = NASXI, Imperva
- NetMon Tools = Nagios, SolarWinds, Netflow Analyzer

- Waterfall SDLC = Gather, Design, Implement, Test, Deploy, Maintain
- RAD SDLC       = Business Modeling, Data Mod., Process Mod., App Gen, Testing

- SCAP = Security Content Automation Protocol

- Packet-Filtering      = Firewall control based on packet headers
- Circuit-Level Gateway = Firewall control based on TCP session states

- TACACS+ = AAA protocol that encrypts the entire auth packet & can control access to iOS commands
